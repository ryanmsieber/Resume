<h1>Question and Answer</h1>
<br>
<h2>What made you interested in studying psychology during your undergraduate career?</h2>
<p>I was interested in studying psychology because it affects so many different aspects of life. Whether it's building relationships, navigating social situations, or growing in your career, psychology has always played a factor, and I wanted to figure out how this all worked.</p>
<h2>If not psychology, what are you interested in now?</h2>
<p>I am still interested in psychology, but I've also grown interested in others areas! What I find great about learning psychology is that you can see it's applications everywhere. One of my current pursuits for example, is growing in the field of Web Development. While, on the surface, it might seem like an entirely different direction to go in, I don't think it actually is! My background in psychology has enabled me to work confidently within a team setting, understand and translate customer needs, and think creatively about how certain designs appeals to different audiences. </p>
<h2>What made you interested in the field of web development?</h2>
<p>I grew interested in Web Development when first creating MySpace pages back in Middle School, where I would use basic HTML and CSS to build out my profile page. After spending some time in the tech space as a customer support member, I realized that I could harness this interest to grow my career in something that I really enjoy. </p>
<h2>Do you feel like you are able to bring your understanding of Psychology into web development?</h2>
<p>Yes, of course!</p>
<h2>Where do you hope to end up?</h2>
<p>I actually don't have a specific job role in mind as "the one" that I want to end up in, and I do hope to end up in a position that allows me to create and design web pages and applications! If I had to be semi-specific, I am interested in a front-end position or a QA position.</p>
<h2>What do you like to do outside of work?</h2>
<p>I really enjoy swimming, biking, running, and being outdoors in general! However, I also have my first child on the way, so I anticipate spending a lot of my time being a parent.</p>
